=============================================   Fixed issues   ===========================================================
	
Projectile only shoots straight, not up/down.
-Projectile Now Shoots where aiming (vertically)

Sword only swings straight, not up and down
-Sword now can be aimed vertically.


Need to create a player spawner, and remove the script attached to Main level
-done

Work on Simple Enemy AI, Animations, etc. how smart?
- have enemy ai that follow,

Enemy AI - when player dies, they do not retarget.
- They now retarget

TODO: make Sure player has no control after death until respawn.
- WASD disabled, added death animation so mouse control is fine ig.

maybe add death/respawn screen
- Added death fade out, respawn fade in, button to respawn etc.


Enemies facing backward, was in the middle of giving them animations, meshes (pcked scnee)
- Enemies now have a rotation, you can flip them in the 'EnemyStats' sub resource. 
- Can easily create new enemies
- animations done (kind of shit but they work for now)

flying enemies - need to figure out ground/air hitbox .. .something something collision layers
- Flying and ground enemies now have proper working hitboxes.


=====================================  TO DO   ===========================================

Enemies dont stagger or anything if theyre hit. need them to stagger and cancel animation, etc.

ENEMY AI: right now they just follow, super basic. 

Maybe add slide mechanic, or if we go forward with beardo maybe like a roll or something.

Also todo - not get to focused, this is supposed to be general purpose for reuse.

I think enemies are respawning - so max of 5, but everytime you kill them they respawn  ? 
	so every kill means max enemies goes up by 1 (unintended.)
