Need to create a player spawner, and remove the script attached to Main level
-done

Work on Simple Enemy AI, Animations, etc. how smart?
- have enemy ai that follow,

TODO ENEMY AI: right now they just follow, super basic. 

Enemy AI - when player dies, they do not retarget.
- They now retarget

TODO: make Sure player has no control after death until respawn.
- WASD disabled, added death animation so mouse control is fine ig.

maybe add death/respawn screen
- Added death fade out, respawn fade in, button to respawn etc.


Enemies facing backward, was in the middle of giving them animations, meshes (pcked scnee)
- Enemies now have a rotation, you can flip them in the 'EnemyStats' sub resource. 
- Can easily create new enemies
x animations not done


Flying Enemies
Issue - When you have a flying enemy, their collision box must be touching the ground, which will give an innacurate hit box. 
Fix - need to set up collision layers ? so they have one touching ground (navigation) and one for player attacks


To do .
Enemies dont stagger or anything if theyre hit. need them to stagger and cancel animation, etc.

to do . 
flying enemies - need to figure out ground/air hitbox .. .something something collision layers
OR - - 2 collision shapes with different collision layers
one for ground one for hitting. i think this is better but idk
